# WPPlugins

wpplugins is a ruby script to help manage plugins across teams/machines. 

**It relies on WP-CLI to actually interact with plugins.**

The benefit of wpplugins is that you/your team can keep track of what plugins your theme requires by creating and maintaining a `plugins.yml` config file in your theme directory.

This is a first version (and a first attempt at writing ruby script) so it is still *very much* not production ready.

*Documentation coming soon*
